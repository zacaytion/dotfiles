#+title: Org Chameleon Export

Sometimes you want your exports to blend in with your Emacs theme.

This currently only works with LaTeX exports, but it would be nice if more
formats could be supported in future. To use with LaTeX just change the
documents =#+latex_class= to use the pseudo-class =chameleon= and
~org-latex-default-class~ will be used with some extra generated preamble content
to make the result similar to your buffer ðŸ™‚.

;; Place your private configuration here! Remember, you do not need to run 'doom
;; sync' after modifying this file!


;; Some functionality uses this to identify you, e.g. GPG configuration, email
;; clients, file templates and snippets.
;;; Code:
(setq user-full-name "Zach Harris"
      user-mail-address "z@zharr.is")

;; Doom exposes five (optional) variables for controlling fonts in Doom. Here
;; are the three important ones:
;;
;; + `doom-font'
;; + `doom-variable-pitch-font'
;; + `doom-big-font' -- used for `doom-big-font-mode'; use this for
;;   presentations or streaming.
;;
;; They all accept either a font-spec, font string ("Input Mono-12"), or xlfd
;; font string. You generally only need these two:
;; (setq doom-font (font-spec :family "monospace" :size 12 :weight 'semi-light)
;;       doom-variable-pitch-font (font-spec :family "sans" :size 13))
(setq doom-font (font-spec :family "Operator Mono" :size 14 :weight 'semi-light )
      doom-big-font (font-spec :family "Operator Mono" :size 26 :weight 'light )
      doom-unicode-font (font-spec :family "JuliaMono")
      doom-variable-pitch-font (font-spec :family "Source Code Variable" :size 14 :weight 'light)
      doom-serif-font (font-spec :family "Space Mono" :size 14 :weight 'light))

;; There are two ways to load a theme. Both assume the theme is installed and
;; available. You can either set `doom-theme' or manually load a theme with the
;; `load-theme' function. This is the default:
(setq doom-theme 'doom-dracula)
;; (beacon-mode 1)
;; (setq beacon-size 80)

;; If you use `org' and don't want your org files in the default location below,
;; change `org-directory'. It must be set before org loads!
(setq org-directory "~/org/"
      org-archive-location "~/org/archive/")

;; Org-ref
;; Set up bibliography
(setq org-ref-default-bibliography '("~/nextcloud/bibliography/myBibliography.bib"))
(setq bibtex-completion-bibliography "~/nextcloud/bibliography/myBibliography.bib")
(global-set-key (kbd "<f6>") #'org-ref-helm-insert-cite-link)

;; Org-roam-bibtex
(require `org-roam-bibtex)
(add-hook 'after-init-hook #'org-roam-bibtex-mode)
(define-key org-roam-bibtex-mode-map (kbd "C-c n a") #'orb-note-actions)

;; This determines the style of line numbers in effect. If set to `nil', line
;; numbers are disabled. For relative line numbers, set this to `relative'.
(setq display-line-numbers-type 'relative)

(menu-bar-mode 0) ;menu bar is explicitly turned on for beginners. Change the value to 0.

;; Here are some additional functions/macros that could help you configure Doom:
;;
;; - `load!' for loading external *.el files relative to this one
;; - `use-package!' for configuring packages
;; - `after!' for running code after a package has loaded
;; - `add-load-path!' for adding directories to the `load-path', relative to
;;   this file. Emacs searches the `load-path' when you load packages with
;;   `require' or `use-package'.
;; - `map!' for binding new keys
;;
;; To get information about any of these functions/macros, move the cursor over
;; the highlighted symbol at press 'K' (non-evil users must press 'C-c c k').
;; This will open documentation for it, including demos of how they are used.
;;
;; You can also try 'gd' (or 'C-c c d') to jump to their definition and see how
;; they are implemented.
